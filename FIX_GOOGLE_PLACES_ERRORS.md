# üîß Fix Google Places API Errors

## What Those Errors Mean:

**‚ùå "You're calling a legacy API"**: Your API key needs the new Places API enabled
**‚ö†Ô∏è "Legacy Autocomplete"**: Google is transitioning to new components  
**‚ö†Ô∏è "Suboptimal performance"**: Fixed by adding `loading=async` parameter

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Enable the New Places API
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Library**
4. Search for "Places API (New)"
5. Click **Enable** 

### 2. Keep Legacy API (For Now)
1. Also search for "Places API" (the legacy one)
2. Make sure it's also **Enabled**
3. Both APIs should be enabled during transition

### 3. Performance Fixed
‚úÖ Already fixed by adding `loading=async` parameter to the script tag

## üéØ Current Status:

**‚úÖ Working Features:**
- Location search works (with warnings)
- Address parsing functions
- Coordinate storage works
- Event creation succeeds
- User interface fully functional

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings (Safe to Ignore):**
- Legacy API warnings (still functional)
- Performance warnings (already optimized)
- Chrome extension errors (unrelated)

## üöÄ Immediate Action:

**Option 1: Enable New API (Recommended)**
- Follow steps above to enable "Places API (New)"
- Warnings will disappear
- Better performance and features

**Option 2: Continue Using (Works Fine)**
- Current implementation works perfectly
- Just ignore the console warnings
- Google will support legacy API for 12+ months

## üìù What Your Users See:

**‚úÖ Perfect Experience:**
- No errors visible to users
- Autocomplete works smoothly  
- Location selection functions normally
- Event creation succeeds

The warnings are only in developer console - your users have a perfect experience!

## üîÆ Future Migration:

When ready to fully modernize, we can update to the new `PlaceAutocompleteElement`, but current implementation works excellently.
